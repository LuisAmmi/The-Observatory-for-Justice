    <span class="mention place" about="Minneapolis" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q36091" data-label="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</span> police officer has reinvigorated a very public debate about <span class="mention concept" about="police brutality" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q1996993" data-label="police brutality">police brutality</span> and
    <span class="mention concept" about="racism" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q8461" data-label="racism">racism</span>.</p>

    <p>As protests have spread around the globe, the pressure is on police departments and politicians, particularly in the <span class="mention place" about="United States" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q30" data-label="United States of America">United States</span>, to do something — from reforming law-enforcement tactics to defunding or even abolishing police departments.</p>

    <p>And although researchers are encouraged by the momentum for change, some are also concerned that, without ample evidence to support new policies, leaders might miss the mark. Many have been arguing for years about the need for better data on the <span class="mention concept" about="use of force" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q96441150" data-label="police violence">use of force</span> by the police in the <span class="mention place" about="United States" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q30" data-label="United States of America">United States</span>, and for rigorous studies that test interventions such as training on how to de-escalate tense interactions or mandating the use of body-worn cameras by officers. Those data and studies have begun to materialize, spurred by protests in <time datetime="2014">2014</time> after the deadly
    <span class="mention type-of-aggression" about="shooting" id="?">shooting</span> of <span class="mention person" about="Michael Brown" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q17516932" data-label="Michael Brown">Michael Brown</span> in <span class="mention place" about="Ferguson" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q954855" data-label="Ferguson">Ferguson</span>, <span class="mention place" about="Missouri" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q1581" data-label="Missouri">Missouri</span>, and the <span class="mention event" about="killing of Eric Garner" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q17400785" data-label="killing of Eric Garner">death by

    <p>Government officials, academic researchers and media outlets launched data-collection projects around that time to better understand the frequency of <span class="mention concept" about="police violence" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q96441150" data-label="police violence">police violence</span> and the risk factors that contribute to it. From these growing data sets come some disturbing findings. About 1,000 civilians are killed each year by law-enforcement officers in the <span class="mention place" about="United States" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q30" data-label="United States of America">United States</span>. By one estimate,
    <span class="mention ethnic_group" about="Black people" id="?">Black man</span> are 2.5 times more likely than <span class="mention ethnic_group" about="White people" id="?">white men</span> to be killed by police during their lifetime.<a href="#footn1"><sup>1</sup></a> And in another study, <span class="mention ethnic_group" about="Black people" id="?">Black people</span> who were fatally
    <span class="mention type-of-aggression" about="shooting" id="?">shot</span> by police seemed to be twice as likely as <span class="mention ethnic_group" about="White people" id="?">white people</span> to be unarmed.<a href="#footn2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

    <p>“We have enough evidence that tells us that action needs to be taken,” says <span class="mention person" about="Justin Nix" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q98156837" data-label="Justin Nix">Justin Nix</span>, a criminologist at the <span class="mention institution University" about="University of Nebraska Omaha" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q2495890" data-label="University of Nebraska Omaha">University of Nebraska Omaha</span>. “One thousand deaths a year does not have to be normal.” Since
    <i><span class="mention company newspaper" about="Nature" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q180445" data-label="Nature">Nature</span></i> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02601-9">reported last September on what the data say about <span class="mention concept" about="racial bias" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q16630756" data-label="racial bias">racial bias</span> and police killings</a>, new evidence has continued to support a link. Data from
    <span class="mention place" about="California" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q99" data-label="California">California</span> show that police stopped and used force against <span class="mention ethnic_group" about="Black people" id="?">Black people</span> disproportionately, compared with other racial groups, in 2018 (see <a href="https://openjustice.doj.ca.gov/exploration/stop-data">go.nature.com/2bgfrah</a>). A <time datetime="2019-12">December 2019</time>December 2019 paper reported that bias in police administrative records results in many studies underestimating levels of <span class="mention concept" about="racial bias" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q16630756" data-label="racial bias">racial bias</span> in policing, or even masking discrimination entirely.<a href="#footn3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

    <p>The data are still limited, which makes crafting policy difficult. A national data set established by the FBI in <time datetime="2019">2019</time>, for example, contains data from only about 40% of US law-enforcement officers. Data submission by officers and agencies is voluntary, which many researchers see as part of the problem.</p>

    <p>“Most agencies do not collect that data in a systematic way,” says <span class="mention person" about="Tracey Meares" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q28839574" data-label="Tracey Meares">Tracey Meares</span>, founding director of the Justice Collaboratory at Yale Law School in <span class="mention place" about="New Haven" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q49145" data-label="New Haven">New Haven</span>, <span class="mention place" about="Connecticut" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q779" data-label="Connecticut">Connecticut</span>. “I hope when people think about the science of this that they understand what we know, what we don’t know and why we don’t know it,” she says. “Policing, in large part for historical reasons, has proceeded in kind of a science-free zone.”</p>

    <h2>Bad apples</h2>

    <p>Scientists must often think creatively to work around the limitations in the data. <span class="mention person" about="Mark Hoekstra" id="?">Mark Hoekstra</span>, an economist at <span class="mention institution University" about="Texas A&M University" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q49212" data-label="Texas A&M University">Texas A&M University</span> in <span class="mention place" about="College Station" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q695511" data-label="College Station">College Station</span>, has attempted to decipher the role of race in police officers’ <span class="mention concept" about="use of force" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q96441150" data-label="police violence">use of force</span>, by comparing responses to emergency calls.</p>

    <p>Based on information from more than two million 911 calls in two US cities, he concluded that <span class="mention ethnic_group" about="White people" id="?">white officers</span> dispatched to <span class="mention ethnic_group" about="Black people" id="?">Black neighbourhoods</span>  <span class="mention type-of-aggression" about="shooting" id="?">fired their guns</span> five times as often as Black officers dispatched for similar calls to the same neighbourhoods<a href="#footn4"><sup>4</sup></a> (see ‘Answering the call’). <span class="mention person" about="Mark Hoekstra" id="?">Hoekstra</span> wonders whether the factors that contribute to an officer <span class="mention concept" about="use of force" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q96441150" data-label="police violence">using excessive force</span> might be predicted in a similar way to how US Major League Baseball teams use sophisticated statistical models to predict whether a player has the potential to be a future all-star.</p>

    <p>Scientists have tried to identify some predictive factors, such as <span class="mention concept" about="racial bias" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q16630756" data-label="racial bias">racial bias</span>, a bad temper, insecure masculinity and other individual characteristics, many of which can be identified through simulations already used in officer training<a href="#footn5"><sup>5</sup></a>. <span class="mention person" about="Justin Nix" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q98156837" data-label="Justin Nix">Nix</span> suggests that such screening could help with vetting officers before they are recruited. But raising the bar for hiring might be impractical, he cautions, because many police departments are already struggling to attract and retain highly qualified candidates.</p>

    <p>Similar forecasting models could recognize patterns of bad behaviour among officers. Data from the <span class="mention institution Police-Department" about="New York City Police Department" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q328473" data-label="New York City Police Department">New York City Police Department</span> suggests that officers who had repeated negative marks in their files were more than three times as likely to <span class="mention type-of-aggression" about="shooting" id="?">fire their gun</span> as were other officers<a href="#footn6"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>

    <p>Such wrongdoing might even be contagious. Another study, published in February, looked at complaints filed against police officers in <span class="mention place" about="Chicago" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q1297" data-label="Chicago">Chicago</span>, <span class="mention place" about="Illinois" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q1204" data-label="Illinois">Illinois</span>. It found that although only a small percentage of officers
    <span class="mention type-of-aggression" about="shooting" id="?">shoot</span> at civilians, those who have done so often serve as “brokers” in the social networks within policing<a href="#footn7"><sup>7</sup></a>. Other officers connected to them were also found to be at greater risk of
    <span class="mention type-of-aggression" about="shooting" id="?">shooting</span>.</p>

    <p>But carrying out disciplinary action, let alone firing a police officer, is notoriously difficult in the <span class="mention place" about="United States" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q30" data-label="United States of America">United States</span>. Union contracts give officers protections that have been tied to increases in <span class="mention concept" about="misconduct" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q6875295" data-label="misconduct">misconduct</span><a href="#footn8"><sup>8</sup></a>. In many states, a bill of rights for law-enforcement officers shields personnel from investigations into

    <span class="mention person" about="Derek Chauvin" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q95693632" data-label="Derek Chauvin">Derek Chauvin</span> out of the policing business ten years ago,” says
    <span class="mention person" about="Lawrence Sherman" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q6174804" data-label="Lawrence W.

    <p>Even officers who are fired for <span class="mention concept" about="misconduct" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q6875295" data-label="misconduct">misconduct</span> are frequently rehired. The police officer in <span class="mention place" about="Cleveland" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q37320" data-label="Cleveland">Cleveland</span>, <span class="mention place" about="Ohio" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q1397" data-label="Ohio">Ohio</span>, who fatally <span class="mention type-of-aggression" about="shooting" id="?">shot</span> 12-year-old

The Cleveland police did not review the officer’s personnel file before hiring him, <i><span class="mention company newspaper" about="The New York Times" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q9684" data-label="The New York Times">The New York Times</span></i> reported in <time datetime="2015">2015</time>. An investigation of public records from Florida showed that about 3% of that state’s police force had previously been fired or had resigned in lieu of being dismissed. The study, published in May, found that these officers tended to move to smaller agencies which served a slightly larger proportion of
    <span class="mention ethnic_group" about="Black people" id="?">Black residents</span> residents, but with no significant difference in crime rates<a href="#footn9"><sup>9</sup></a>. They also appeared to be more likely to commit <span class="mention concept" about="misconduct" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q6875295" data-label="misconduct">misconduct</span> in the future compared to officers who had never been fired.</p>

    <p>“If an officer is fired for <span class="mention concept" about="misconduct" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q6875295" data-label="misconduct">misconduct</span>, or resigned to avoid an investigation, they shouldn’t be able to get hired by another agency,” says <span class="mention person" about="Seth Stoughton" id="?">Stoughton</span>. “This is a low-hanging fruit.”</p>

    <p>Federal legislation introduced last month targets barriers to good and fair policing. One bill would effectively end the doctrine of qualified immunity, by which courts have largely prevented officers from being successfully sued for <span class="mention concept" about="abuse of power" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q1975478" data-label="abuse of power">abuse of power</span> or <span class="mention concept" about="misconduct" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q6875295" data-label="misconduct">misconduct</span> since the mid-<time datetime="1969">1960</time>s (ref. <a href="#footn10"><sup>10</sup></a>). A similar bill proposes a number of measures intended to increase
    <span class="mention concept" about="police accountability" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q7209546" data-label="police accountability">police accountability</span>, training and data collection, including a national police <span class="mention concept" about="misconduct" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q6875295" data-label="misconduct">misconduct</span> registry to keep record of when an officer is fired or quits. Although Democrats in <span class="mention place" about="Washington DC" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q61" data-label="Washington, D.C.">Washington DC</span> broadly support the bills, Republicans unveiled a competing, weaker proposal that does not address the issue of qualified immunity. This came on
    <time datetime="2020-06-17">17 June</time> — a day after President <span class="mention person" about="Donald Trump" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q22686" data-label="Donald Trump">Donald Trump</span> signed an executive order that incentivizes police reform. The order drew swift criticism over its relatively narrow breadth and lack of teeth.</p>

    <p><span class="mention person" about="Robin Engel" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q47087757" data-label="Robin Engel">Robin Engel</span>, director of the Center for Police Research and Policy in <span class="mention place" about="Cincinnati" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q34196" data-label="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</span>,<span class="mention place" about="Ohio" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q1397" data-label="Ohio">Ohio</span>, suggests that the real capacity for change is at the state and local levels. “There’s a collective citizen call to action now to hold political leaders responsible for ensuring that the police are collecting data, releasing data and operating with best practices,” says
    <span class="mention person" about="Robin Engel" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q47087757" data-label="Robin Engel">Engel</span>.</p>

    <h2>Evidence-based policing</h2>

    <p>It remains unclear which law-enforcement practices are actually best, largely because of a lack of data and science. “We’re operating in the dark about what are the most effective strategies, tactics and policies to move forward with,” <span class="mention person" about="Robin Engel" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q47087757" data-label="Robin Engel">Engel</span> says.</p>

    <p>Political leaders and activists pushing for change in the <span class="mention place" about="United States" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q30" data-label="United States of America">United States</span> have widely endorsed body-worn cameras, de-escalation training, implicit-bias training, early intervention systems, the banning of <span class="mention type-of-aggression" about="chokehold" id="?">chokeholds</span>, and civilian oversight since the tragedies of <time datetime="2014">2014</time>. A survey of 47 of the largest US law-enforcement agencies between <time datetime="2015">2015</time> and
    <time datetime="2017">2017</time> found that 39% changed their use-of-force policies in <time datetime="2015">2015</time>-<time datetime="2016">2016</time> and revised their training to incorporate tactics such as de-escalation. Among the agencies surveyed, officer-involved <span class="mention type-of-aggression" about="shooting" id="?">shootings</span> dropped by 21% during the study period<a href="#footn11"><sup>11</sup></a>.</p>

    <p>“But as we have seen in the last several weeks — from <span class="mention place" about="Minneapolis" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q36091" data-label="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</span> and from the police response to the protests — there’s a great deal that still has to change in policing,” says <span class="mention person" about="Laurie Robinson" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q96002022" data-label="Laurie O. Robinson">Laurie Robinson</span>, a criminologist at <span class="mention institution University" about="George Mason University" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q1411222" data-label="George Mason University">George Mason University</span> in <span class="mention place" about="Fairfax" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q341915" data-label="Fairfax Country">Fairfax</span>,
    <span class="mention place" about="Virginia" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q1370" data-label="Virginia">Virginia</span>.</p>

    <p>Researchers are advocating collection of better data, such as tracking situations in which force was avoided by de-escalation strategies or, when force was used, recording whether it was at a lower level than it might previously have been.</p>

    <p>The <span class="mention institution Police-Department" about="Oklahoma City Police Department" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q7082149" data-label="Oklahoma City Police Department">Oklahoma City Police Department</span> is among agencies working to fill that void. It now collects details on the applicability of each specific de-escalation tactic and technique any time force is used. “Since the implementation of our de-escalation policy, our use-of-force numbers have decreased,” states <span class="mention person" about="Megan Morgan" id="?">Megan Morgan</span>, a police sergeant and spokesperson for the department.</p>

    <p>he collection of data might itself hold police officers more accountable. In one study, a requirement that officers file a report when they point their guns at people but do not fire was associated with significantly reduced rates of gun death<a href="#footn12"><sup>12</sup></a>.</p>

    <p>The use of body-worn cameras could be among the easiest interventions to enhance <span class="mention concept" about="police accountability" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q7209546" data-label="police accountability">accountability</span>. The technology gained traction after a randomized experiment published in <time datetime="2014">2014</time> compared shifts in which all officers wore cameras all the time with shifts in which they never did<a href="#footn13"><sup>13</sup></a>. The likelihood of force being used by officers with cameras was roughly half that of officers without cameras. Furthermore, camera-wearing officers received about one-tenth the number of complaints as did officers without cameras.</p>

    <p>Results of more-recent studies have been mixed. When the <span class="mention institution Police-Department" about="Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q1350854" data-label="Las Vegas Police Department">Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department</span> in <span class="mention place" about="Nevada" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q1227" data-label="Nevada">Nevada</span> implemented body cameras, it experienced significant drops in both the rate of complaints and the <span class="mention concept" about="use of force" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q96441150" data-label="police violence">use of force</span><a href="#footn14"><sup>14</sup></a>. But when the <p>The <span class="mention institution Police-Department" about="Oklahoma City Police Department" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q7082149" data-label="Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia">Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia</span> did the same, it found no benefits (see <a href="https://bwc.thelab.dc.gov/#results">go.nature.com/3heuxac</a>). The differences might have more to do with policies that allow officers to choose when to turn on their cameras, as well as a lack of controls for situations in which one officer shows up wearing a camera while another does not, notes
    <span class="mention person" about="Lawrence Sherman" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q6174804" data-label="Lawrence W. Sherman">Sherman</span>. The latter could dilute true differences in the rates of complaints or uses of force.</p>

    <p>“It would be a travesty if we got rid of body cams,” says <span class="mention person" about="Lawrence Sherman" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q6174804" data-label="Lawrence W. Sherman">Sherman</span>. “They very often help to clarify what happened.”</p>

    <p>Evidence suggests that encouraging officers to listen to citizens’ views before making decisions and to generally demonstrate an interest in working with members of a community can be another effective intervention. A one-day training programme based on these principles of procedural justice — a model of policing that focuses on respect, neutrality and transparency — was shown to reduce both citizen complaints and <span class="mention concept" about="use of force" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q96441150" data-label="police violence">use of force</span> by officers in the <span class="mention institution Police-Department" about="Chicago Police Department" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q1340186" data-label="Chicago Police Department">Chicago Police Department</span><a href="#footn15"><sup>15</sup></a>.</p>

    <p>“If police are to be of service to communities, they need to build trust with communities that are likely to distrust them,” says <span class="mention person" about="Thomas O’Brien" id="?">Thomas O’Brien</span>, a researcher at the Social Action Lab at the <span class="mention institution University" about="University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q457281" data-label="University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign">University of Illinois in Urbana–Champaign</span>. His work suggests that such trust-building requires the police to both acknowledge its role in creating the distrust, as well as apologize for it<a href="#footn16"><sup>16</sup></a>. Any half-hearted attempts at reconciliation could backfire, he says. Special training can be difficult, however, particularly in smaller jurisdictions, which have been shown to have a higher rate of police

    <p>In the wake of <span class="mention event" about="killing of George Floyd" id="?"><span class="mention person" about="George Floyd" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q95677819" data-label="George Floyd">Floyd</span>’s death</span>, many calls for change have gone beyond police reform to defunding police departments — reducing their public funding and reallocating resources to other programmes — or dismantling them altogether. Some researchers caution against fully abolishing police departments. That could have “disastrous consequences”, says <span class="mention person" about="Robin Engel" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q47087757" data-label="Robin Engel">Engel</span>. “It’s better to work within and demand significant and meaningful change, and then hold them accountable for that change.”</p>

    <p>However, <span class="mention person" about="Robin Engel" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q47087757" data-label="Robin Engel">Engel</span> does support proposals that would begin “carving off pieces” of law-enforcement agencies’ current responsibilities that might fall outside their expertise — or might not require an armed response — such as issues of homelessness, drug abuse and <span class="mention disorder" about="mental disorder" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q12135" data-label="mental disorder">mental illness</span>. In <span class="mention place" about="New York City" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q60" data-label="New York City">New York City</span>, the police purview goes as far as to include enforcement of street-vendor licences. Across the
    <span class="mention place" about="United States" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q30" data-label="United States of America">United States</span>, an arrest is made every 3 seconds; less than 5% of these are for serious violent crimes, according to the Vera Institute of Justice in Brooklyn,
    <span class="mention place" about="New York City" id="?" data-wikidata-id="Q60" data-label="New York City">New York</span> (see <a href="https://www.vera.org/publications/arrest-trends-every-three-seconds-landing/arrest-trends-every-three-seconds/overview">go.nature.com/3fbwmcn</a>) .</p>

    <p>Curtailing police encounters could also result in fewer crimes. Research published last year found that <span class="mention ethnic_group" about="Black people" id="?">Black</span> and <span class="mention ethnic_group" about="Latino people" id="?">Latino boys</span> who are stopped more often by police are more likely to commit crimes months later<a href="#footn18"><sup>18</sup></a>.</p>
